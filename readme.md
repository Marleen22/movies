# Case Backend Developers

## Assignment
Create a webpage on which you can search for movie trailers.

* Use an API of an online movie database (e.g. IMDB or Rotten Tomatoes);
* Use an API of an online video service (e.g. YouTube or Vimeo);
* Create your own WebAPI as middleware to retrieve the results of both services and aggregate them;
* Make the search as smart as you can;

### Tips
* Showing a lot of embedded videos on your page increases page load time significantly;
* BONUS: Add the option to share trailers on social networks.
